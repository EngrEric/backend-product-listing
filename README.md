# Product Listing GraphQL API
This backend infrastructure for a product listing application is built with NestJS, a powerful and extensible Node.js framework. The backend implements a GraphQL server using Apollo Server to handle product-related data. It provides functionalities such as fetching a list of products, retrieving detailed information about a specific product, and integrating postgresql as data source for seamless frontend development.
